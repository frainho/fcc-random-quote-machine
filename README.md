# randomQuoteMachine
A random quote machine

Created this from a challenge over at Free Code Camp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine

It uses an API from https://quotesondesign.com that generates quotes. Aditionally it was required to have a button to easily tweet the Quote that would be presented.

While building I investigated how to do a responsive website without Bootstrap which is how I learned previously how to do a responsive website.

I have plans to have a duplicate from this project with Vanila JS to learn how to manage API calls.
